            <p class="about-text">My name is Jakob Vapper. I am a 17-year-old student studying web development at Kuressaare Ametikool, located in the city of Kuressaare, Estonia. I am extremely passionate about coding, working out, and playing video games. Ever since I can remember, I have been fascinated by the world of technology. As a child, I was always intrigued by how websites and applications were built and operated. This curiosity led me to pursue web development as my chosen field of study. Currently, I am enrolled in the web development program at Kuressaare Ametikool, where I am honing my skills in HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript - the building blocks of modern web development. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies, eager to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field. Apart from coding, I am also enthusiastic about leading an active lifestyle. I enjoy working out and staying physically fit, as it helps me stay focused and energized while pursuing my studies. In my free time, I also indulge in playing video games, which not only provides me with entertainment but also serves as a creative outlet for me to explore new ideas and concepts in game design. My goal is to become a proficient web developer and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology. I am excited about the endless possibilities that web development offers, and I am committed to constantly pushing my boundaries to improve my skills and stay ahead in this dynamic field.</p>
